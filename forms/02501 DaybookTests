''Note: 14/02/14 - got a message from Ian saying that this form wasn't opening. When I tried to open it, I got an ODBC connection error.
''Turns out it couldn't insert a row into the DaybookTest table because that SpecimenNo already existed.
''Turns out that the specimen number had been entered into GW, then the specimen number and GW SpecID imported into Moka, and then
''the specimen was deleted from the specimen table, and then re-entered which resulted it in being assigned a new GW SpecID.
''This cause a conflict due to duplicate specimen numbers in Moka when it tried to import. The workaround is to delete the old entry
''in the DaybookTest table and then the import code will run as there is no longer a duplicate.
''The fix is to find out how this is being done in GW and then prevent that from happening.
''Use query w140521_FindBadSpecimens to find the offending spec no.
